Codes used to track septae of rotating filaments imaged in TIRF microscopy for figures 4 and 5.

Raw data is videos such as /data/21-Feb-23_TIRF473-7.tif/

Use TIRF_1...ipynb and TIRF_2...ipynb to track the trajectories of the septae (walls between adjacent cells within a chain). Output of these codes is provided in /data/TIRF/*experiment_name*/linked_septae.csv

Use TIRF_3...ipynb and TIRF_4...ipynb to produce filtered tracks of the bright 'blobs' that describe a helical path as the filament moves forward/rotates. Output of these codes is provided in /data/TIRF/*experiment_name*/tracks/*experiment_name*_filtered.csv

These outputs are used to produce figures 4 and 5.
