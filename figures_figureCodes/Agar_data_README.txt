Agar video data was processed by cropping out areas from the full field of view that show a single filament moving on its track. An example of one of these cropped videos is provided in ../data/2024-03-12_AgarSandwich_Circle_1in50_01-25_HCRed_50ms_x4_2s_130_FILAMENT1. Other videos used are available upon request. 

Each cropped video was analysed using the codes Agar_Single_Filament_1segment then Agar_Single_Filament_2analysis, giving filament trajectories as an output. We provide the trajectory produced from the example video: ../data/Olympus_x4_2sec_2024-03-12_1in50dil_130_FILAMENT1_data.csv.

Summary statistics are calculated from multiple filament trajectories and are provided in ../data/0_all_data_summary.csv or 0_all_data_dwell_data.csv

These summary data files are used to produce the final figures.
